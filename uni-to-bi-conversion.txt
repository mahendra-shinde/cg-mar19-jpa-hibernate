How to convert "Uni" directional into "Bi" directional associations


1. Locate the Entity class which contains "OneToOne" or "ManyToOne" or "ManyToMany" annotations
	ex. Class "Student" contains "OneToOne" annotation

2. Locate the OTHER entity used by Association mapping annotation
	ex. Student is Mapped to "Address" using OneToOne annotation

3. Note down the property name (variable name) assigned to the OTHER entity
	ex. In Student class, property "address" is assigned OneToOne

4. Open the OTHER entity
	ex. Open "Address" class

5. Add new property that refers to First entity with matching annotation
	use "mappedBy" to provide a reference, use var-name from step# 3
	ex.
		@OneToOne(mappedBy="address")
		private Student student;
6. Generate Getter/Setters for new property
